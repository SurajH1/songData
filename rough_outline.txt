Look at spotify top 50 US using spotify web API, (can add current billboard songs)
Grab the lyrics of the 50 songs using Genius API,

TODO:
Get Top 50 Songs from spotify playlist (using base URL)
	1. Take ID's to grab each song's features in spotify and make a new Dict
	2. Build a dictionary with the songs to input into genius.py to grab lyrics

Figure out what we want to do with the features given (what sparks joy/innovation) and the lyrics from Genius
	1. Make a list of commmon word to filter out of the dictionary
	2. Maybe a dictionary of words from Genius Lyrics (




Stretch Goals:
	- Look into each song's lyrics for mentions that can tie the song to a genre/audio feature(s) or learn/explain some trends in music culture that arent obvious
		- This can include seasonal/specific things that can be graphed like google trends ot show some sort of trend in the music
		- Google Trends Esc
		- Use searchbar to create custom google trends like graph based on the lyrics in the top 50 (add side meta data with yearly avg or something similar)
		- Display current general trends of the playlist to the user like (Today's Popular Genre in the US is Rap (yesterday's was pop))
